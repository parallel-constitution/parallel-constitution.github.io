Happy with your current constitution? No? Well, you've come to the right(s) place

## Concept / the issue we are trying to solve

* What is the difference between right and wrong? 
* How do you tell the difference between good and evil? 
* How do you decide if you are _pro_ or _con_ on an issue:
* Are you positive or negative?


There have been, are, and will be many suitable, just and good answers to these questions. Every answer is different. Even when answers appear to be identical, they differ because of the varying context that gave rise to that answer in its particular time, place and _milieau_.

Parallel Constitution is a place where you may find, compare and contrast the many different questions and answers. You may use this input to help you determine a good response for the questions of different eras, locations or social organizations.


We may say that all the answers to the questions of good and evil contains elements of good and evil. And, on the whole, this is good. It would be sad if we all agreed on everything. 

Welcome to a place that agrees on disagreeing in the nicest, smartest, most knowledgeable ways. Welcome to Parallel Constitution. 


## Examples

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1976
* Article 6. Every human being has the inherent right to life
