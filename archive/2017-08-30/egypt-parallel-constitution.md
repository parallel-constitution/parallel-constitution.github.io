Preamble and Constitution

## Preamble and Nine Guiding Principles

Driven by our cognizance of our responsibility before the nation, our will toward a unified nation, and our insistence on laying down the foundations for peace in Egypt; and standing strong with our belief in human rights and the principles of national sovereignty, we the Egyptians who are members of the Parallel Constitution Project strive for a real alternative that befits Egypt’s future and its citizens, as we work toward a nation that honors the blood of Egyptians who died in the two great revolutions of January and June in the name of freedom, justice, equality, and the rule of law.

We have found it unacceptable for Egypt &mdash; among the nations that established human rights internationally in 1948 &mdash; to live in a world guided by these principles, while we are barred from the spirit of their covenants. Despite centuries of injustice and backwardness, our civilization persists to prevail.

Our task force comprises specialized Egyptian experts in various applications of public policy, civil society, business, media and hard sciences, who advocate the interests of the real user of the Constitution as a social contract between the citizen and the State.

And based on this, we present this draft of the Constitution to strive for a full guarantee of rights, rather than minimal rights, and to reflect the following nine principles:

Sovereignty is for the people alone.
* On power and the general exercise of authority: We emphasize the importance of ensuring the power of the people to the greatest possible. We find the most effective way to accomplish this is through the full decentralization in administration, financing, and legislation, rather than simple delegation of limited executive responsibilities.
* On legislation: All authority other than that derived from the people plays no role in this Constitution. Legislative reference must be as responsive and vibrant as the conscious of its people, and this must be reflected in the laws that emerge from it.

The Constitution is a vision for the future and not a portrayal of the status quo with its imperfections.

* Our Constitution thus must respond to the changing environment and its tools of production and communication that shape the future and shift the comparative strengths of various constituencies of our nation.

Checks and Balance.

* This Constitution establishes checks and balances among the three powers of the State for the sake of a healthier democracy and stronger nation.

Actionable Legal Language.

* This Constitution eliminates any ornate language that is not actionable and cannot be translated into law or practice. This is an essential first remedy to the corrosion of the rule of law and eventual state failure. Consequently, this Constitution is thus disinterested in defining an identity for Egypt, be that Arab or Egyptian, secular or religious, etc. Egypt is only defined by its people: an independent state with full sovereignty and its people is the source of all powers.

Practice overrides identity.

* There are practices that are prohibited, but not the existence of identities or ideas. Prohibited practices are those that benefit specific communities or deny benefits to others.

Public order is vested not in stability, but in promoting human advancement which in turn brings stability.

* Promoting human advancement therefore calls for the change of the status quo for the better and not plaguing it in hope to preserve stability. Therefore, each and every State institution shall be committed to this principle in organizing its bylaws and external relations with citizens.

The State treats all its citizens equal.

* The State shall establish or fund no institution whose mission or services or admission requirements discriminate among its citizens, and no such institution shall benefit from the State in any way, including but not limited to, tax breaks or revenues.
* In addition, this Constitution is committed to empowering minorities that do not enjoy adequate representation in public life. These minorities shall enjoy the right to expression and representation in formal affairs of the State, including but not limited to, practicing local governance using their indigenous languages and values, and contributing to enrich our national cultural heritage.

The rights and freedoms set forth in this Constitution are unalienable, and are not granted by the State.

* As such, each entity and every person shall be responsible for respecting these rights and freedoms and for facilitating their access to fellow citizens by order of the social contract. The State shall have no authority to grant or prevent any of these rights or freedoms, but is only concerned with facilitating the rules and ensuring the provision of necessary public resources for citizens to access such rights. This includes but is not limited to prevention or punishment of any aggression or infringement upon such rights and freedoms by order of its monopoly over legitimate force.

National Security is an instrument of sovereignty and part of national wealth.

* Like with national currency, a State exhibits good governance by limiting the supply and usage of national security practices, to preserve such tool from inflation and loss of intrinsic value. To that end, the State shall take a proactive approach to promote greater freedoms that increase interactive social practices in the public domain, in a manner that limits unrest or disruption and keeps state that require forceful intervention from the State.

The location for meetings will alternate among the governorate locations for a period of one year for each governorate.

### :

The following general guidelines apply to the Parliament:

The election for the members of the two houses will take place via a secret direct ballot. Voters may request an early election for the seat that represents them according to the guidelines set by local government.

To run for Parliament, a candidate must be an Egyptian national who enjoys his civil and political rights, whose age is not under 25 years, and who has been a resident for not less than three years of the area which he is running to represent. This last requirement is not necessary for those who have spent at least one year serving in local councils. 34.4.

A member of Parliament will be granted a bonus from the Public Treasury of the Egyptian Republic as the law may provide.

A Parliament shall be convened for two years, as this is the length of term renewal in both houses.

A year-long session is split into two seatings, the first of which begins upon a decree from the President of the Republic two weeks after the announcement of election results. If the seating is not called for, then the year-long session will meet as the law may provide. Sessions will last at least seven months and they will not end until a budgetary report is produced and the ratification of the final report takes place.

Either of the two houses may convene an extraordinary meeting by a summons from their speaker, and this is in extenuating circumstances or upon a majority vote of members.

Any speech or discussion that takes place during a meeting will not be inquired about elsewhere.

Each house, with a majority approval of its members, shall set its own guidelines to govern the activities of the house. These guidelines may be changed at the beginning of each new year-long session.

Neither of the two houses, or both of them if they meet in the capital, shall pass a decision unless the meeting is attended by a majority of the house’s members. And in the situations in which a majority vote is not required (two-thirds of the members), decisions will be issued by an absolute majority of those in attendance. In the case of a tie, the matter that was discussed will be considered rejected.

Members of Parliament have the right to propose laws.

Once a bill is approved by one house, it must be reviewed by the other house. In the case of approval by both houses, and with the exception of matters that require a vote of the majority, the bill will be submitted to the President for approval. It will become law thirty days after the President’s approval and announcement to the public.

It is the right of the President of the Republic to veto a bill. In the case that the President refuses the bill, it will return to the two houses and if a two-thirds majority of each house approves the bill, the bill shall become law despite the veto of the President.

Either house of Parliament may direct questions to those in positions of public service under the authority of the Egyptian republic. Either house of Parliament may also conduct investigations into matters within its jurisdiction, which does not preclude judicial or administrative investigations into the matter.

Each house of Parliament has a right to create committees in order to conduct its work. Each house may determine the formation of such committees based on internal guidelines without contravening the general rules of this Constitution. 34.23.
