## Mission FAQ


## What problems are we trying to solve?

What is the difference between right and wrong? How do you tell the difference between good and evil? Are you positive or negative?

People have been asking these questions - and seeking answers for thousands of years. Th good new is that people have also been discussing, agreeing and recording response to these question for many thousands of years. 

The difficult thing is that people of differing religious, philosophical, political, location and more have quite differing sets of beilefs.

Thus what is good for one person may be evil for another,

It would be nice if you could ask questions and receive good answers. But even if you concentrate on a tiny highly homogeneous community in a remote location you are still highly likely to be confronted by disparate views.

Or if you survey a million people with a common set of question you are likely to receive different response based on wealth education and identity.

So are right and wrong totally flexible or relative concepts?  Are no ways of establish acceptable judgments?

Of course there are. There are constitutions, systems of laws and regulations in operation through out the world.

***

People need help in coming to agreement. People forget to consider important aspects. Even though there's plenty of experience, people may not be able to access that experience.

We want to help by providing.

* Concise list of items to be considered
* Examples for each item from across the entire existing political spectrum
* Provide apps to help you navigate the range of possibilities


## Strategy

There are many, many thousands of constitutions, articles of agreements, charters and so on. Trying to catalog all these would take much time and effort.

All of the above documents follow very similar patterns. The number of distinct items may only number in the hundreds or low thousands 
 
Our strategy will be to start woth two or three efforts and identify the common elements. Once a basic list of components is identified, then a number of constitutions will be examined.

As much as possible items in each constitution will be identified and cross-referenced to similar items in the basic lists. Unique items will be highlighted,

Procedures will be established to determine whether these unique items should be added to the basic list or tagged as 'specials'.

Ultimately there may be several hundred (more?) documents available. Every clause in the baic list will be linked to the equivalent cluse inthe various documents.

It should be possible to crowd source the addition of new documents.

The proces of parsing a fresh document should be fairly straightfoward one the details of the basic list have been established. Such an effort may lend itself to AI.


## Rights FAQ

_Theo ~ 2017-07-04: I look forward to expanding this section and turning into a short online introduction to the essence of matters relating to constitutions and civil rights._



### _What is a [constitution]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.



### _What are [rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory


#### _What are [Human Rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights )?_

> Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights "to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being," and which are "inherent in all human beings" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture and execution.


#### _What are [Fundamental rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights )?_

> * Right to self-determination - their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.
> * Right to liberty - No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention
> * Right to due process of law
> * Right to freedom of movement
> * Right to freedom of thought
> * Right to freedom of religion
> * Right to freedom of expression
> * Right to peaceful assembly
> * Right to freedom of association

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fundamental_rights

### _What is the [rule of law]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials.




## Technical FAQ



### _What is the mission of the tech aspects of Parallel Constitution effort?_

We want to enable:

* Multiple contributions for multiple contributors handled equally, quickly and intelligently
* Multiple copies of efforts in multiple locations around the world
* Multiple tools and apps all fast, easy and available at no monetary cost


_The following questions outline a proposed strategy of using available tools to develop and accomplish the mission._



### _What is a [Version Control]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Wikipedia entry" ) system (VCS)?_

> A component of software configuration management, **version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

> The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.



### _Why is using a VCS beneficial?_

> Benefits of a VCS that is [distributed revision control system (DRCS)]( Distributed revision control system (DRCS) ) include:

> Distributed revision control takes a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a complete repository. 

> Distributed revision control system synchronizes repositories by exchanging patches (sets of changes) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

> * No canonical, reference copy of the code base exists by default; only working copies.
> * Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.
> * Communication is only necessary when sharing changes among other peers.
> * Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, protecting against data loss.


> Other differences include:

> * Multiple "central" repositories.
> * Code from disparate repositories is merged based on a web of trust, i.e., historical merit or quality of changes.
> * Numerous different development models are possible, such as development / release branches or a Commander / Lieutenant model, allowing for efficient delegation of topical developments in very large projects.[3] Lieutenants are project members who have the power to dynamically decide which branches to merge.
> * A separate set of "sync" operations are available for committing or receiving changes with remote repositories.
> * DVCS proponents point to several advantages of distributed version control systems over the traditional centralised model:

> DVCS proponents point to several advantages of distributed version control systems over the traditional centralised model:
> * Allows users to work productively when not connected to a network.
> * Makes most operations much faster.
> * Allows participation in projects without requiring permissions from project authorities, and thus arguably better fosters culture of meritocracy[citation needed] instead of requiring "committer" status.
> * Allows private work, so users can use their changes even for early drafts they do not want to publish.
> * Avoids relying on one physical machine as a single point of failure.
> * Permits centralized control of the "release version" of the project
> * On FOSS software projects it is much easier to create a project fork from a project that is stalled because of leadership conflicts or design disagreements.



### _What is [Git?]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git  "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.



### _Why is Git beneficial?_

> Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.

> As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.

> Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.




### _What is [GitHub]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub )?_

> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control system (VCS) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.



### _Why is GitHub beneficial?_

> GitHub is mostly used for code.

> In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:

> Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see README files on GitHub)
> Issue tracking (including feature requests) with labels, milestones, assignees and a search engine
> Wikis
> Pull requests with code review and comments
> Commits history
> Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members
> Integrations Directory[14]
> Unified and split diffs
> Email notifications
> Option to subscribe someone to notifications by @ mentioning them.
> Emojis
> GitHub Pages: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://username.github.io.
> Nested task-lists within files
> Visualization of geospatial data
> 3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas".[17] The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three.js.
> Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.



### _What is a [fork]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) )?_

> In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.

> Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g. Unix) also happen.



### _What is [free and open source software]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software )?_


> Free and open-source software (FOSS) is computer software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.[a] That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.[3] This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually hidden from the users.


### _What are the benefits of FOSS?_

> The benefits of using FOSS can include:

>* decreasing software costs
>*increasing security and stability (especially in regard to malware), 
>* protecting privacy
>* and giving users more control over their own hardware. 

> Free, open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendents of BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g. Android), and other devices.[4][5] Free software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages. The open-source software movement is an online social movement behind widespread production and adoption of FOSS.



### _What is the mission of the Parallel Constitution effort to help contributors create contributions?_

The content for VC is almost always via [plain text]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text ) files.

This means that documents saved in Microsoft Word or Google Docs or LibreOffice formats are not well processed by VC.

We want to enable:

* As much functionality as possible for changing style and adding links and images to files in plain text format
* A minimal learning curve by using systems already widely adopted
* Access to multiple editors written in multiple languages



### _What is [Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown )?_

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.

### _what are some of the benefits of Markdown?_

> Sites such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users


There are many available free Markdown editors that work eiter online of offline

Online Markdown editors include
