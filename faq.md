## Rights FAQ

_Theo ~ 2017-07-04: I look forward to expanding this section and turning into a short online introduction to the essence of matters relating to constitutions and civil rights._

### _What is a [constitution]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.

### _What are [rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Wikipedia entry" ) ?_

> Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory

### _What is the [rule of law]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials.

### What is a [Version Control]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Wikipedia entry" ) system (VCS)

> A component of software configuration management, **version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

> The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.

### Why is using a VCS beneficial?

Benefits include

Distributed revision control takes a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a complete repository. 

Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by exchanging patches (sets of changes) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

* No canonical, reference copy of the codebase exists by default; only working copies.
* Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.
* Communication is only necessary when sharing changes among other peers.
* Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, protecting against data loss.


Other differences include:

* Multiple "central" repositories.
* Code from disparate repositories is merged based on a web of trust, i.e., historical merit or quality of changes.
* Numerous different development models are possible, such as development / release branches or a Commander / Lieutenant model, allowing for efficient delegation of topical developments in very large projects.[3] Lieutenants are project members who have the power to dynamically decide which branches to merge.
* A separate set of "sync" operations are available for committing or receiving changes with remote repositories.
* DVCS proponents point to several advantages of distributed version control systems over the traditional centralised model:

More
* Allows users to work productively when not connected to a network.
* Makes most operations much faster.
* Allows participation in projects without requiring permissions from project authorities, and thus arguably better fosters culture of meritocracy[citation needed] instead of requiring "committer" status.
* Allows private work, so users can use their changes even for early drafts they do not want to publish.
* Avoids relying on one physical machine as a single point of failure.
* Permits centralized control of the "release version" of the project
* On FOSS software projects it is much easier to create a project fork from a project that is stalled because of leadership conflicts or design disagreements.

### What is [Git?]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git  "Wikipedia entry" )

> Git s a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### Why is Git beneficial

### _What is [GitHub]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub )?_

> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control system (VCS) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
