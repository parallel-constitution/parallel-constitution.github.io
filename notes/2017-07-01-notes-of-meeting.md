# Notes of Meeting

Google Hangout called to order by Mak on 2017-07-01
Present: Sawsan, Mohamed & Theo

## Edited version of Theo's scribbles taken during the meeting

Our work is for the benefit of everybody

Change date of events from 2013 to 2011

Many people in Egypt are concerned about elections of politicians.
They need persuading that voting on constitutional issues is even more important

The need to involve the average person

Help them 
* share articles
* Use social media

Help people to monitor and audit local government  

It's a humongous task, but we need to build the foundations, stone by stone

The process must be one of adding values
- especially by small business and similar groups

Certification would be good - similar to LEED certification
* for government departments
* for individuals


Even though quite location focused, must also be able to help refugees
* but must be able to audit funds, their spending and origins

Mechanisms for finding lawyers and support



## Further notes from Theo's memory

### Enthusiasm

Mohamed said he would be willing to break from his banking career if the opportunity to really do something arises.

Theo said that these things take a long time. This was not a good response!
A better response would have been to applaud the intention and encourage further effort.

### Idemyx

Sawsan that that a lot of work for Idemyx was already complete. 

Theo has registered and submitted a test ranking. A bit tricky, but got there in the end.

Theo wonders: is there a business plan or any other supporting documentation for this effort?

### Coding

Mohamed mentioned that he is not a programmer. This is OK. We are looking to use the techniques and strategies of tech for non-tech purposes

### Privacy
We talked a lot about public and private rights.

Theo just made this up: Any data that is public for one should be public for all. Any data that is private for one should be private for all.

We will many more discussions on this topic

### Monetization

A fair amount of chat on this topic

General agreement that there's no need to be a billionaire, but making numerous people prosper is a better priority
