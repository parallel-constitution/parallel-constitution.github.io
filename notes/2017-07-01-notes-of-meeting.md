Google Hangout called to order by Mak on 2017-07-01
Prsent: Sasun, Mohammed & Theo

## Edited version of Theo's cribbles

Our work is for the benefit of everybody

Change date of events from 2013 to 2011

Many people in Eqgypt are concerned about elections of politicians. They need persuading that voting on constitutional isses is even more important

Need to involve the average person

* Help them share articles
* Use social media

Help people to monitor and audit local government  

It's a humongous task, but we need to build the foundations, stone by stone

The process must be one of adding values
- especially by small busoness and similr groups

Certification would be good - similar to LEED certification
* for government departments
* for individuals


Even though quite location focussed, must also be able to help refugees
* but must be able to audit funds, their spending and origins

Mechanisms for finding lawyers and support



## Further notes from Theo's memory

Mohammed said he would be willing to break from his banking career if the opportunity to really do something arises.

Theo said that these things take a long time. This was not a good response!
A better response would have been to applaud the intention and encourage furthereffort.

Sawsun that that a lot of work for Idemx was already complete. Theo would like to know where there work can be seen.
