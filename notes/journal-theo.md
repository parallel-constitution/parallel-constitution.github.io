> Perhaps the most interesting finding of Zhu and Greenstein's research is that the more times an article is revised on Wikipedia, the less bias it is likely to show—directly contradicting the theory that ideological groups might self-select over time into increasingly biased camps.

> "The data suggests that people are engaging in conversation with each other online, even though they have different points of view," says Zhu. "The crowd does exhibit some wisdom, so to speak, to self-correct bias."

* [Do Experts or Collective Intelligence Write with More Bias? Evidence from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia]( https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/do-experts-or-collective-intelligence-write-with-more-bias-evidence-from-encyclopdia-britannica-and-wikipedia )
> Using a matched sample of pairs of articles from Britannica and Wikipedia, we show that, overall, Wikipedia articles are more slanted towards Democrat than Britannica articles, as well as more biased. Slanted Wikipedia articles tend to become less biased than Britannica articles on the same topic as they become substantially revised, and the bias on a per word basis hardly differs between the sources.

	* When faced with interpreting an act of Congress, his colleagues evidently now feel free to invoke legislative history — committee reports, floor debates and the like — without tiptoeing over the hot coals of his scorn.
	* The text is the law,” he would say — the text of the statute and nothing but the text. Anything else was “a kind of ventriloquism,” he once wrote in dissent because “words appear to come from Congress’s mouth” that might actually have been put there by staff aides, lobbyists or who knows who else.

I cannot find a list of laws or enactments that are considered to be be guided by strict constructionism.

From blog post

The formatting of the text on the home page has been cleaned up.

The Contributors page page links and icons have been merged together.

In general the site is beginning to fulfill its ambition: Documenting the activities, resources and output of the effort in 2013 to draft an alternative constitution for Egypt following the Arab Spring of 2011.

Deleted from WordPress site

What is a right and what should or should not be a right is an ongoing important topic of interest in my life. I am very pleased to be able to help a group of people who have gone through the process of drafting a constitution of rights during a dramatic, traumatic and enigmatic  period in their country's history.</blockquote>

### Draft of a home page
What is the difference between right and wrong? How do you tell the difference between good and evil?

_Having odd numbers is a more elegant writing style. What is is a good third sentence?_

* How do you decide if you are _pro_ or _con_ on an issue:
* Are you positive or negative?


There have been, are, and will be many suitable, just and good answers to these questions. Every answer is different. Even when answers appear to be identical, they differ because of the varying context that gave rise to that answer in its particular time, place and _milieau_.

Parallel Constitution is a place where you may find, compare and contrast the many different questions and answers. You may use this input to help you determine a good response for the questions of different eras, locations or social organizations.


We may say that all the answers to the questions of good and evil contains elements of good and evil. And, on the whole, this is good. It would be sad if we all agreed on everything.

Welcome to a place that agrees on disagreeing in the nicest, smartest, most knowledgeable ways. Welcome to Parallel Constitution.


#### Examples

The strategy will be to list side-by-side equivalent sentences or phrases from multiple constitutions. Every sentence will indicate its source and date.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1949
* Article 3. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.


The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1976
* Article 6. Every human being has the inherent right to life
* Article 9. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person


Egypt Parallel Constitution, 2013
* Section 1.3. Each individual has the right to life, freedom, and privacy in peace of mind and personal security

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty

Generally, liberty is distinctly differentiated from freedom in that freedom is primarily, if not exclusively, the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved. As such, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others,
