# FAQ

## Mission FAQ


### What problems are we trying to solve?

What is the difference between right and wrong? How do you tell the difference between good and evil? Are you positive or negative?

People have been asking these questions - and seeking answers for thousands of years. 

Difficulties with finding the answers include:

* Beliefs/heart/feelings. people of differing religious, philosophical, political, location and more have quite differing sets of beliefs. Thus what is good for one person may be evil for another,
* Value/Quality. Because of phones, computers and the Internet we are exposed to more data which gives us more insights which in turn makes everything more complicated
* Time. Because of improved scheduling, greater need to work harder for more money of faster advancement, we may have less time just to think things over,

The good new is that people have also been discussing, agreeing and recording response to the questions we tend to ask for many thousands of years. Even with all this good advice there are issues. 

* People do not Agree. It would be nice if you could ask questions and receive good answers. But even if you concentrate on a tiny highly homogeneous community in a remote location you are still highly likely to be confronted by disparate views.
* People haves biases. if you survey a million people with a common set of question you are likely to receive different response based on wealth education and identity.


### _How can we [stand on the shoulders of Giants]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants )?_

So are right and wrong totally flexible or relative concepts?  Are there no ways of establishing acceptable judgments?

Of course there are. There are constitutions, agreements, systems of laws and regulations in operation throughout the world that define what and is not acceptable behavior for a particular milieu.

Almost all of these documents are based scholarly efforts that have citations and are well referenced. For the most part they are based on the collective agreement and consensus of large numbers of people. 

These documents provide clear, considered and acceptable answers for many of the difficult question to life.

The reason that they are not used enough

* Difficult to access
* Difficult to compare and contrast

### _What is the overall strategy?_

People need help in coming to agreement. People forget to consider important aspects. Even though there's plenty of experience, people may not be able to access that experience.

We want to help by providing.

* List of items to be considered well catalogued so the search may be as concise as possible
* Examples for each item from across the entire existing political spectrum of biases
* Provide references and citations to outcomes
* Provide apps to help you navigate the range of possibilities


There are many, many thousands of constitutions, articles of agreements, charters and so on. Trying to catalog all these would take much time and effort.

All of the above documents follow very similar patterns. The number of distinct items may only number in the hundreds or low thousands 

Our strategy will be to start with two or three efforts we have deemed as worthy starting points. We will triage and parse the documents extensively and do our best to identify the common elements. Once a basic list of components is identified, then a larger number of constitutions will be examined.

As much as possible items in each constitution will be identified and cross-referenced to similar items in the basic lists. Unique items will be highlighted,

Procedures will be established to determine whether these unique items should be added to the basic list or tagged as 'specials'.

Ultimately there may be several hundred (more?) documents available. Every clause in the basic list will be linked to the equivalent clauses in the various documents.

It should be possible to crowd source the addition of new documents.

The process of parsing a fresh document should be fairly straight foward one the details of the basic list have been established. Such an effort may lend itself to AI.


### What patterns would we like to establish?

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.


#### Common responses to important questions should be readily available


#### Similar questions should be grouped so people may see patterns more clearly


#### Answers/Responses to questions should be tagged by their various biases - right/left, rich/poor, devout/atheist and so on (in much more detail )


#### Extra expenses, unintended outcomes and other surprises and success stories need to be linked to each question



## Rights FAQ

_Theo ~ 2017-07-04: I look forward to expanding this section and turning into a short online introduction to the essence of matters relating to constitutions and civil rights._



### _What is a [constitution]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> A constitution is a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed.



### _What are [rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory


#### _What are [Human Rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights )?_

> Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights "to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being," and which are "inherent in all human beings" regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture and execution.


#### _What are [Fundamental rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights )?_

> * Right to self-determination - their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.
> * Right to liberty - No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention
> * Right to due process of law
> * Right to freedom of movement
> * Right to freedom of thought
> * Right to freedom of religion
> * Right to freedom of expression
> * Right to peaceful assembly
> * Right to freedom of association

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Fundamental_rights


### _What is [self determination]( self-determination )?_

> The right of people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a jus cogens rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter’s norms.[1][2] It states that a people, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference

> By extension the term self-determination has come to mean the free choice of one's own acts without external compulsion


### _What is the [rule of law]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> The rule of law is the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials.


### _What are [civil liberties]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties )?_

> Civil liberties or personal freedoms are personal guarantees and freedoms that the government cannot abridge, either by law or by judicial interpretation, without due process. Though the scope of the term differs between countries, civil liberties may include the freedom from torture, freedom from forced disappearance, freedom of conscience, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to security and liberty, freedom of speech, the right to privacy, the right to equal treatment under the law and due process, the right to a fair trial, and the right to life. Other civil liberties include the right to own property, the right to defend oneself, and the right to bodily integrity. Within the distinctions between civil liberties and other types of liberty, distinctions exist between positive liberty/positive rights and negative 



### _What is [Liberty]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty )?_

> Generally, liberty is distinctly differentiated from freedom in that freedom is primarily, if not exclusively, the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; whereas liberty concerns the absence of arbitrary restraints and takes into account the rights of all involved. As such, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others.


### _What are [natural and legal rights]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights )?_

> Natural and legal rights are two types of rights. Natural rights are those that are not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable (i.e., rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws). Legal rights are those bestowed onto a person by a given legal system (i.e., rights that can be modified, repealed, and restrained by human laws).



## Scholarly Method FAQ

### _What is the [Scholarly method]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_method )?_

> The scholarly method or scholarship is the body of principles and practices used by scholars to make their claims about the world as valid and trustworthy as possible, and to make them known to the scholarly public. It is the methods that systemically advance the teaching, research, and practice of a given scholarly or academic field of study through rigorous inquiry. Scholarship is noted by its significance to its particular profession, and is creative, can be documented, can be replicated or elaborated, and can be and is peer-reviewed through various methods.

> It is part of the scientific method...

### _What is the [scientific method]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method )?_

> The scientific method is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry is commonly based on empirical or measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford Dictionaries Online defines the scientific method as "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses". Experiments need to be designed to test hypotheses. Experiments are an important tool of the scientific method.

> The method is a continuous process that begins with observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The strongest tests of hypotheses come from carefully controlled experiments that gather empirical data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general theory may be developed.


_Theo: for me the best example of the Scholarly Method is Wikipedia. Below are some links that outline Wikipedia policy and guidelines._


### _What are the Wikipedia Five Pillars?_

> The fundamental principles of Wikipedia may be summarized in five "pillars":

>**Wikipedia is an encyclopedia**
> It combines many features of general and specialized encyclopedias, almanacs, and gazetteers. Wikipedia is not a soapbox, an advertising platform, a vanity press, an experiment in anarchy or democracy, an indiscriminate collection of information, or a web directory. It is not a dictionary, a newspaper, or a collection of source documents, although some of its fellow Wikimedia projects are.

> **Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view**
> We strive for articles that document and explain major points of view, giving due weight with respect to their prominence in an impartial tone. We avoid advocacy and we characterize information and issues rather than debate them. In some areas there may be just one well-recognized point of view; in others, we describe multiple points of view, presenting each accurately and in context rather than as "the truth" or "the best view". All articles must strive for verifiable accuracy, citing reliable, authoritative sources, especially when the topic is controversial or is on living persons. Editors' personal experiences, interpretations, or opinions do not belong.

> **Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute**
> Since all editors freely license their work to the public, no editor owns an article and any contributions can and will be mercilessly edited and redistributed. Respect copyright laws, and never plagiarize from sources. Borrowing non-free media is sometimes allowed as fair use, but strive to find free alternatives first.

> **Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility**
> Respect your fellow Wikipedians, even when you disagree. Apply Wikipedia etiquette, and don't engage in personal attacks. Seek consensus, avoid edit wars, and never disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point. Act in good faith, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming to newcomers. Should conflicts arise, discuss them calmly on the appropriate talk pages, follow dispute resolution procedures, and consider that there are 5,469,152 other articles on the English Wikipedia to improve and discuss.

> **Wikipedia has no firm rules**
> Wikipedia has policies and guidelines, but they are not carved in stone; their content and interpretation can evolve over time. The principles and spirit matter more than literal wording, and sometimes improving Wikipedia requires making exceptions. Be bold but not reckless in updating articles. And do not agonize over making mistakes: every past version of a page is saved, so mistakes can be easily corrected.

### _What is [Verifiability]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability )?_

> In Wikipedia, verifiability means that other people using the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source. Wikipedia does not publish original research. Its content is determined by previously published information rather than the beliefs or experiences of its editors. Even if you're sure something is true, it must be verifiable before you can add it. When reliable sources disagree, maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.

> All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations, and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people that is unsourced or poorly sourced.


### _What is [Citing sources]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources )?_

> Wikipedia's Verifiability policy requires inline citations for any material challenged or likely to be challenged, and for all quotations, anywhere in article space.

> A citation or reference in an article usually has two parts. In the first part, each section of text that is either based on, or quoted from, an outside source is marked as such with an inline citation. The inline citation may be a superscript footnote number, or an abbreviated version of the citation called a short citation. The second necessary part of the citation or reference is the list of full references, which provides complete, formatted detail about the source, so that anyone reading the article can find it and verify it.


### _Whats does [Identifying reliable sources]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources ) mean?_

> Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered (see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view). If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.

> The guideline in this page discusses the reliability of various types of sources. The policy on sourcing is Wikipedia:Verifiability, which requires inline citations for any material challenged or likely to be challenged, and for all quotations. The policy is strictly applied to all material in the mainspace—articles, lists, and sections of articles—without exception, and in particular to biographies of living persons, which states:





## Technical FAQ



### _What is the mission of the tech aspects of Parallel Constitution effort?_

We want to enable:

* Multiple contributions for multiple contributors handled equally, quickly and intelligently
* Multiple copies of efforts in multiple locations around the world
* Multiple tools and apps all fast, easy and available at no monetary cost


_The following questions outline a proposed strategy of using available tools to develop and accomplish the mission._



### _What is a [Version Control]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Wikipedia entry" ) system (VCS)?_

> A component of software configuration management, **version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

> The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files.



### _Why is using a VCS beneficial?_

> Benefits of a VCS that is [distributed revision control system (DRCS)]( Distributed revision control system (DRCS) ) include:

> Distributed revision control takes a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a complete repository. 

> Distributed revision control system synchronizes repositories by exchanging patches (sets of changes) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from a centralized system:

> * No canonical, reference copy of the code base exists by default; only working copies.
> * Common operations (such as commits, viewing history, and reverting changes) are fast, because there is no need to communicate with a central server.
> * Communication is only necessary when sharing changes among other peers.
> * Each working copy effectively functions as a remote backup of the codebase and of its change-history, protecting against data loss.


> Other differences include:

> * Multiple "central" repositories.
> * Code from disparate repositories is merged based on a web of trust, i.e., historical merit or quality of changes.
> * Numerous different development models are possible, such as development / release branches or a Commander / Lieutenant model, allowing for efficient delegation of topical developments in very large projects.[3] Lieutenants are project members who have the power to dynamically decide which branches to merge.
> * A separate set of "sync" operations are available for committing or receiving changes with remote repositories.
> * DVCS proponents point to several advantages of distributed version control systems over the traditional centralised model:

> DVCS proponents point to several advantages of distributed version control systems over the traditional centralised model:
> * Allows users to work productively when not connected to a network.
> * Makes most operations much faster.
> * Allows participation in projects without requiring permissions from project authorities, and thus arguably better fosters culture of meritocracy[citation needed] instead of requiring "committer" status.
> * Allows private work, so users can use their changes even for early drafts they do not want to publish.
> * Avoids relying on one physical machine as a single point of failure.
> * Permits centralized control of the "release version" of the project
> * On FOSS software projects it is much easier to create a project fork from a project that is stalled because of leadership conflicts or design disagreements.



### _What is [Git?]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git  "Wikipedia entry" )?_

> Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.



### _Why is Git beneficial?_

> Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.

> As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.

> Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.




### _What is [GitHub]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub )?_

> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control system (VCS) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.



### _Why is GitHub beneficial?_

> GitHub is mostly used for code.

> In addition to source code, GitHub supports the following formats and features:

> Documentation, including automatically rendered README files in a variety of Markdown-like file formats (see README files on GitHub)
> Issue tracking (including feature requests) with labels, milestones, assignees and a search engine
> Wikis
> Pull requests with code review and comments
> Commits history
> Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members
> Integrations Directory[14]
> Unified and split diffs
> Email notifications
> Option to subscribe someone to notifications by @ mentioning them.
> Emojis
> GitHub Pages: small websites can be hosted from public repositories on GitHub. The URL format is http://username.github.io.
> Nested task-lists within files
> Visualization of geospatial data
> 3D render files that can be previewed using a new integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a "3D canvas".[17] The viewer is powered by WebGL and Three.js.
> Photoshop's native PSD format can be previewed and compared to previous versions of the same file.



### _What is a [fork]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) )?_

> In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.

> Free and open-source software is that which, by definition, may be forked from the original development team without prior permission, without violating copyright law. However, licensed forks of proprietary software (e.g. Unix) also happen.



### _What is [free and open source software]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software )?_


> Free and open-source software (FOSS) is computer software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.[a] That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.[3] This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright and the source code is usually hidden from the users.


### _What are the benefits of FOSS?_

> The benefits of using FOSS can include:

>* decreasing software costs
>*increasing security and stability (especially in regard to malware), 
>* protecting privacy
>* and giving users more control over their own hardware. 

> Free, open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendents of BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g. Android), and other devices.[4][5] Free software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages. The open-source software movement is an online social movement behind widespread production and adoption of FOSS.



### _What is the mission of the Parallel Constitution effort to help contributors create contributions?_

The content for VC is almost always via [plain text]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text ) files.

This means that documents saved in Microsoft Word or Google Docs or LibreOffice formats are not well processed by VC.

We want to enable:

* As much functionality as possible for changing style and adding links and images to files in plain text format
* A minimal learning curve by using systems already widely adopted
* Access to multiple editors written in multiple languages



### _What is [Markdown]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown )?_

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.

## Organization FAQ


### _What is the mission for the way we are organized?_

The goal of this endeavor is to help small groups of people to accomplish amazing goal or projects.

The methods to achieve this purpose should be 1. accessible, 2. useful and 3. delightful.
