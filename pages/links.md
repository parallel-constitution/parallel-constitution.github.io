> In a new world dominated by fast-paced technology, every government institution needs to come to relevancy.
 
> That is why &quot;MonitorGov&quot; was born!

>&quot;MonitorGov&quot;, owned by iDemyx, is an online platform and app that collects and publishes crowd-sourced reviews about government institution services. &quot;MonitorGov&quot; also enables verified representatives of government institutions, central and local, to respond to reviews, resolve cases, and receive petitions.

In many the Parallel Constitution project is a precursor or training ground intended to help Idemyx gain its proper place in the world.

We want to praise when there are efforts tthat are well and truly worth praising. We want to help prevent people for blaming others when perhaps they themselves were the issue.

We feel that by providing clear and strong guidance as to what is right and wrong in a particular culture or society that people in turn in giving their assessments on the service or lack of service by people who are in public service will do so with a greater sense of fairness and justice.
